**VSim** is a RISC-V assembler and runtime simulator for educational purposes made in Java. Almost all the 32-bit base integer ISA can be simulated as well as the **M** and **F** extensions with all their respective pseudo-instructions. For a complete list of supported instructions, as well as the installation guide, please visit the [wiki](https://github.com/andrescv/VSim/wiki) page.
